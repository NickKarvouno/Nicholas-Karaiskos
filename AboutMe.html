        <h2>So you wanna hear about me? Well get some popcorn because I'll 
            tell you about the first programming language that I learnt and
            my journey to becoming a programmer(Yes I consider myself a programmer, please don't judge me...)
        </h2>

    <div class="p2">
        <h3>
            First and Foremost, my journey started when I was 10 years 
            old(As you had read in the <a class="span1" href="index.html">Home</a> 
            section).Back then, I was really really fascinated about Gaming.I loved Gaming
            and I still do but I don't like them as much as I used to.One day, I discovered Roblox's Roblox Studio
            where you build your own games and publish it.So I started working on a game which at the end I never published it
            as it had a lot of bugs which needed to be fixed.Therefore, I can confidently say that my first programming language was
            Roblox Studio's programming language, which was named Lua.

            After that, I was bored of Lua and decided to try Python and hey, I found it pretty interesting.
            Everyday when I woke up, I had an idea to accomplish in python, for example a calculator or a coffee shop(Shoutout to <a class="span2" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9x0AN7BWHpCDHSm9NiJFJQ" target="_blank">NetWorkChuck</a>
            for teaching me how to make a coffee shop in PythonðŸ˜ˆ). Anyway, After some time I got bored of Python and I decided to try another programming
            Language and I found HTML,CSS AND JAVASCRIPT(The programming languages which are used to build websites).There I found a very helpful
            video from <a class="span2" href="https://www.youtube.com/@SuperSimpleDev" target="_blank">SuperSimpleDev</a> and even if his video about HTML & CSS was a 6 hour video, it was very informative and helpful.
            I was following his tutorials line by line. (I Also forgot to mention that I was 11 years old at that time). From that video I learned everything about Web Development.

            Later on I wanted to move on to HARDWARE. Now this is the stuff I enjoyed the most. I had opened up my laptop for a deep internal clean and RAM upgrade. Heck,
            I even had cleaned my moms laptop inside out without making any mistakes in both of these two devices. I even had replaced the thermal paste. Now I know I had mentioned at the <a class="span1" href="index.html">Home</a> section
            but that Is a thing I'll do in the nearcoming summer so yeah...Anyway, After some time, my birthday had come, so I became 12 years old.

    <div class="p5">
        <h3>
            At the end, well I made a choice to come back to Lua and sooner or later I Will be publishing a game On Roblox.
            Hey and now I came back to building websites, that's why I'm here. Also, creating websites is like having my own personal diary which other people can see
            .Phew, that was a lot of talking wasn't it.Thank you for listening to my speech. Have a great day!!!
